# CodeAlpha_Basic_Chatbot
A simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs like "hello", "how are you", and "bye" with predefined replies. Built using Python's if-elif statements, functions, loops, and input/output. It runs in a loop until the user says "bye", making it a great beginner project to understand chatbot logic.
